# unwatermarkpdf
A simple bash script to remove annoying watermarks in PDF on Linux or compatible systems.
Has an option to cut of pages at begining and end of your pdf.
Requires: pdftk, sed, bash

__Usage:__
    ./unwatermarkpdf.sh file.pdf "text you want to remove" _range (optional)_

(For range syntax I refer to the  "cat [<page ranges>]" part of the pdftk man page.)
